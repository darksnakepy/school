            <p>No, I don’t want to sound preachy and it’s not that I have figured out everything. I have learned from my mistakes. I have been a yes-woman, a passive-aggressive person for the longest time. It has taken me years to understand what it truly means to live life as your true self and I, to date, strive to live by the definition every day. I have seen people truly be themselves and how confident they look.</p>
            <p>Living as your true self makes you enjoy life more and feel light like a feather. Living as your true self and doing what the heart wants makes you feel good, confident, and proud. It brings fulfillment and happiness. Something most humans spend their entire lives trying to find. You see, it’s not that complicated if you commit to it. Here’s how you can do it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Understanding yourself. Ask yourself hard questions. What are your interests? What are your strengths, weaknesses? What values do you hold? If you don’t know, start writing it down and start exploring. Answers never come easy. You just have to keep looking. Accept all your flaws and own up to yourself. Remember, what you practice daily becomes a habit, it becomes permanent. Commit to yourself to make a continuous effort to do things that make you feel alive and live a more meaningful life.
                </li>
                <li>Do What You Say You Will Do. Once you have an idea of what kind of life you would like to live, start taking action. Consistency is the key. Align your words with actions and be accountable. When we don’t do what we say we’re going to do, for ourselves and for others, we ail our credibility, resulting in lost confidence and missed connections. However small your efforts are, they are significant to you and others who care. Make it your mantra “Do What You Say You Will Do” so you can focus on things you really want.</li>
                <li>Be Courageous and Assertive. This one is challenging for me and most people I know. It is not always easy to call someone out when necessary or say no to things. I am learning to choose courage over comfort every day. It is important to communicate and be assertive without being aggressive. Think before you speak and say what you want to say when you are sure. Learn to communicate in a friendly, soft, empathetic yet assertive way. It is a very essential skill to learn.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Love & Light,<br>
